# AIOSaber BeatSaver Cache
A simple in-memory cache which is in place as middleware between [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com) and the AIOSaber
Client.

### Scope
Caching responses for by-hash and by-id requests and reducing the load on BeatSaver. 

# Installation
This is **not** intended for client use, it's server software. If you are aware of that, then you also know how to
install this :^).
